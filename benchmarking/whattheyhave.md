# What they have
This is main about what have already been developed

I have done the study, and write something [here](https://github.com/Virsin/EVEMarket-Analysis/blob/master/docs/3rd%20party%20app%20for%20eve.md)

This is the list of all 3rd party tools I have discovered and tried

[EVE第三方工具](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12y_sf_TW4jyQe5aG5jScwSfTGJf2-rkOqMR4gU31hlI/edit#gid=1477184384)

## State-of-Art

I would say the best trading application is [EVERNUS](https://evernus.com/)

This is a fully developed application. Providing some functions only appealed in this app:

1. Margin tool: Which allow your export market data from client, and **instantly** do the math and tell you how much you can earn
2. Trading history: You want to know how much you have earned this week right, and which day you earned much more/less than others... This would tell you
3. Trading lifecycle: This is the only one show me the lifecycle of trading... Trading is not buy low and sale high only,,,, you have to wait for a long time until someone sell/buy things from you... and if you meet high-rate competition, your 10B isk will stay in escrow forever and do nothing...so, you would like to know, how long time your investment would become return.
4. Market analysis with customisable filter: Most powerful filter, even can score the item for you.

Drawback:

1. very slow for pulling data: I am not sure the root cause of the slow. It's very painful when you want to pull big data, eg. multiple categories, multiple station or multiple regions. Often dies during data pulling if your want to pull too much data.
2. Almost impossible to get the data and analysis for interregional hauling
3. Still need some analysis to verify the competition

## Secondary

[ISK Per Hour](https://eveiph.github.io/) would be second of EVERUNS. The common between the two is they both grab tons of marketing data. But they have different proposes, different way to process the data.

IPH is more closed to manufacturing people, the aim is to let you find the idea item to buy, and give a clue about how much you can earn after you buy lots of material from market.

I think the best part of the project is the concept of ISK Per Hour, that measure the performance in more sustainable way. Yeah, I want to know how much I can make per week,,, or per hour.

## Other worth to have a check

[evetrade](https://evetrade.space/) can help you about station trading and hauling, with limited efforts. Actually, I started my trading business with this. But soon, I found that it didn't cover many type of items, eg. the ship skin.... and with the result data,,, you must have a double check in [evemarketer](https://evemarketer.com/), otherwise, you can be trapped with scams.


By the way [evemarketer](https://evemarketer.com/) is the **BEST** offline market browser, so simple and beautiful to use.  Their [API](https://api.evemarketer.com/ec/) is the one best alterative api to ESI, much better than other EVE APIs


 [Fuzzwork Market Data](https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/) is also one great market data API,,, or a mirror of CCP market database. This developer,,, seems become a CCP employee afterwards (not sure). He also developed [fuzzwork](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/), a superb EVE toolbox, almost everything.

[adam4eve](https://www.adam4eve.eu) is another legend of trading in EVE. His side is ugly, he is not that good of frontend, BUT he is real economist, his insight of market is superb. You will learn a lot from here,,,,but this site is not a handy tool.
